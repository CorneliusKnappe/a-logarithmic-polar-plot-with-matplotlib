A logarithmic polar plot with matplotlib

A Jupyter notebook for a nice looking logarithmic polar plot
############################################################## 


In research group of Prof. Weimar at the Eberhard-Karls University i wrote a jupyter-notebook which plots lograithmic polar plots. I read a lot about problems with 'log' scale and polar plots, so i wanted to share my work-around with you. This work-around is based on the simlog scale. Therefore, check also the difference between log and simlog in your usage.
Hopefully, someone reads this, who is more in to matplotlib,  can fix the problems and makes matplotlib a bit more powerfull.
