A logarithmic polar plot with matplotlib

A Jupyter notebook for a nice looking logarithmic polar plot
############################################################## 


In the research group of Prof. Weimar at the Eberhard-Karls University i wrote a jupyter-notebook which plots lograithmic polar plots. I read a lot about problems with 'log' scale and polar plots, so i wanted to share my work-around with you. It's based on the simlog scale. Therefore, check also the difference between log and simlog in the jupyter-notebook for your usage case.
Hopefully, someone who is more into matplotlib can fix the problems in a better way and makes matplotlib a bit more powerfull. Check the code for more details.
